# arduinoforlittlekids

**Goals**
 - explore ideas
 - get feedback from experts
 - build one hardware thing with your arduino, then this repo will help you out with a dozen software options that do different things with that hardware
 - Explain the basics and best practices. Skillbuilding through making. No dead ends. Anticipate and avert common frustrations.
 - Unblock myself faster by asking for help
 - Make my mission clear so others can quickly decide if they want to help
